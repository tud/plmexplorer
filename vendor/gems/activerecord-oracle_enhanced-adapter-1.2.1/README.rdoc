== DESCRIPTION:

Oracle "enhanced" ActiveRecord adapter contains useful additional methods for working with new and legacy Oracle databases
from Rails which are extracted from current real projects' monkey patches of original Oracle adapter.

See http://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced/wikis for more information.

Bugs and enhancement requests can be reported at http://rsim.lighthouseapp.com/projects/11468-oracle-enhanced

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Works (has been tested) with ActiveRecord version 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 (these are the same as Rails versions)
* Can be used on the following Ruby platforms:
  * MRI - requires ruby-oci8 1.x or 2.x library to connect to Oracle
  * Ruby/YARV 1.9.1 - requires ruby-oci8 2.x library to connect to Oracle
    unicode_utils gem is recommended for Unicode aware string upcase and downcase
  * JRuby - uses JDBC driver ojdbc14.jar to connect to Oracle (should be in JRUBY_HOME/lib or in PATH)
* Requires ruby-plsql gem to support custom create, update and delete methods (but can be used without ruby-plsql if this functionality is not needed)

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter
